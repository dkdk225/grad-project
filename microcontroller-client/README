to support larger mqtt communications change: 
  increase the packet size in PubSubClient.h
    #define MQTT_MAX_PACKET_SIZE 256 to 
    #define MQTT_MAX_PACKET_SIZE 2048 

to reduce watchdog timer issues:
  increase the size of the _async_queue in AsyncTCP.cpp
    _async_queue = xQueueCreate(32, sizeof(lwip_event_packet_t *)); to 
    _async_queue = xQueueCreate(64, sizeof(lwip_event_packet_t *));
